## Graf Czterech 

We're a group of Computer Science students from Adam Mickiewicz University (AMU) working on various projects. Some of these are silly, some are greater than life and some are just another Wednesday.
We're also a part of [AI Star](https://github.com/Kolo-Naukowe-AI-Star) science club, where we actively participate in another projects, mostly related to AI.

### Projects
As for now, we made just one public project as Graf Czterech, which consists of three repositories. This is a project we completed as part of our studies to earn our engineering degree.

Following repositories are a part of this project:
- [stripe-kit](https://github.com/GrafCzterech/STRIPE-kit) (Public ✔️) -- Our toolkit for simplification of work with Nvidia IsaacLab
- [forest-gen](https://github.com/GrafCzterech/forest_gen) (Public ✔️) -- Forest scene generation module showcasing usage of stripe-kit
- [forest-nav](https://github.com/GrafCzterech/forest_nav) (Private ❌) -- Reinforcement Learning navigation task for Boston Dynamics Spot training in Nvidia IsaacLab

We're planing to work together on another projects in the future. Make sure to follow us, if you want to be up to date with our shenanigans.
